## 🔧 How It Works
### **Step 1: Load Dataset**
- The dataset (`tips.csv`) contains features such as total bill, gender, smoker status, day, and time of visit.
- It is preprocessed to convert categorical variables into numerical values.

### **Step 2: Train Machine Learning Model**
- A regression model is trained using the dataset.
- The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### **Step 3: Generate Predictions & Visualizations**
- The trained model predicts tip amounts based on input features.
- Various graphs such as scatter plots and residual distributions are generated to analyze performance.
